NodeJsCah
=========

This was the first node.js project I ever tried, so likely a lot of ugly code in here. The idea was a basic game engine where users can play different games (Cards Against Humanity and Go Fish are included here).

NOTE: This requires a Parse account (settings needed in config.js)

Node Modules Required
